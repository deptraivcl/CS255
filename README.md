Briefly summarize the DriverPass project. Who was the client? What type of system did they want you to design?
The DriverPass project basically help improve the passing rate for student or anyone who want to study for their driving test. It also help users schedule their on the road lesson and connect them with instructors and learning material either online or offline. 
What did you do particularly well?
Identify the system and see what the system need in term of hardware or software requirement. 
If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?
I think that would be the diagram of the DriverPass system. I feel like I didn't include everything that was asked from the owner of DriverPass. 
How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your system design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?
You have to look at the functional requirement of the system versus the nonfuctional requirement. When you can determine what the system really need then it will help you identify what the user want to see in the system. 
How do you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a system?
I definitely will use the software like Lucid Chart to help me design the system. The more diagram you create the easier it will get for developers to understand how the system work.
